      <p class="text-justify"><strong>Indian culture</strong> and traditions are something which has now become renowned all across the world.  We all refer to customs and traditions of India as something very diverse and unique. But seldom do we give a thought to why things are done in certain specific ways. Indian culture is full of several unique customs and traditions, which outsiders might find intriguing. Most of these originate from the Ancient Indian scriptures and texts, which have dictated the way of life in India for thousands of years.</p>
      <h1>Here are 16 fascinating Indian Culture, Traditions and customs</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Greetings</li>
        <li>Religious Customs</li>
        <li>Festivals of India</li>
        <li>Family Structure & Marriage</li>

      <h2>1. Greeting - The Namaste</h2>
      <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/cmsuploads/compressed/An_Oberoi_Hotel_employee_doing_Namaste_New_Delhi_20190823105959.jpg" alt="" width="50%">
      <p class="pt-3">The Namaste is one of the most popular Indian customs and isn't just restricted to the Indian territory anymore. You have Barack Obama, who has been seen doing it on various occasions, or you had Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary-General, greeting everyone with a namaste at the Times Square in New York on the first International Yoga Day.</p>
      <h2 class="pt-5">2. Festivals & Religion - Always a Festive Season</h2>
     <img src="https://www.holidify.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13896645072_c994520879_k.jpg" alt="" width="50%">
     <p class="pt-3">India also sees a large number of festivals, mainly because of the prevalence of diverse religions and groups. The Muslims celebrate Eid, the Christians have Christmas and good Friday, the Sikhs have Baisakhi (harvesting of crop), and the birthdays of their Gurus and the Hindus have Diwali, Holi, Makar Sakranti, the Jains have Mahavir Jayanti, the Buddhists celebrate the Buddha's birthday on Buddha Poornima, and quite honestly, the number is endless. All of these translate to holidays in our book, of course.</p>
     <h2 class="pt-5">
      3. Family Structure - Joint Families
     </h2>
     <p class="pt-3">Also, in India, there exists the concept of a joint family, wherein the entire family (parents, wife, children and in some cases, relatives) all live together. This is mostly because of the cohesive nature of the Indian society, and also reportedly helps in handling pressure and stress.</p>
     <h2 class="pt-5">4. Architecture - The Science Behind Temples
    </h2>
    <img src="https://www.holidify.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6231574226_36212304b0_b.jpg" alt="" width="50%">
    <p class="pt-3">Most temples are located along magnetic wave lines of the Earth, which help in maximising the available positive energy. The copper plate (called Garbhagriha or Moolasthan) buried under the main idol absorbs and resonates this energy to its surroundings. Going to the temple often helps in having a positive mind and garnering positive energies, which in turn lead to healthier functioning.</p>
    <h2 class="pt-5">5. Indian Dances</h2>
    <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/cmsuploads/compressed/2263141278_21320385d4_o_20191004140006.jpg" alt="" width="50%">
    <p>India is a land of 'unity in diversity', and our dances are no different. Different forms of dance(classified as folk or classical) find origin from different parts of the country, and they are a way of representation of the particular culture from which they originate. Eight classical dances, which are classified as Indian classical dances and find a mention in the Hindu Sanskrit text 'Natyashashtra', (a text of performing arts) are:</p>
    <h2 class="pt-5">6. Languages</h2>
    <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/cmsuploads/compressed/Word_cloud_of_Indian_languages_and_scripts_20191004142933.png" alt="" width="50%">
    <p>India is socially, culturally, and linguistically very diverse. Hindi and English are widely spoken and recognised for official purposes. Other than than, there are 22 scheduled languages recognised by the constitution of India. However, more than 400 languages and dialects in India are still not known. Dialects change even with a few kilometres of travel in the state. Over the years, about 190 languages have become endangered due to very few surviving speakers.</p>
