                    Soak half a teaspoon of saffron in some milk. Take a heavy bottomed pan and heat 4 tablespoons of ghee/mustard oil. Add a few black cardamoms, cloves, whole red peppers, cumin, whole peppercorns and some hing. Roast for a few seconds and add a kg of meat, cut in pieces. Fry until brown, and then add half a cup of water and cook on a slight flame for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk two tablespoons of yogurt with a tsp of maida. Add a tablespoon of red chilli powder, a tablespoon of fennel powder, half a teaspoon of ginger powder and half a teaspoon of coriander powder along with the saffron milk created in the beginning. Mix everything, add this to the fried meat and cook till the meat softens. You can pour some oil infused with “ratanjot”, if you have it and a one teaspoon of garam masala. Serve with hot rice or any kind of bread.</p>

                    <p class="pt-3">Love South Indian delicacies? Try this wholesome breakfast dish, which can also be savoured in the evening. <br> <br>

                        Heat a teaspoon of ghee, a ¾-cup jaggery and a cup of coconut (grated). Mix and cook for 5 minutes until the jaggery melts and then add a quarter teaspoon of cardamom powder. Now, roast a cup of fine rice flour on a low flame and let it cool down. Boil 1½ cups of water with one teaspoon of ghee and half a teaspoon of salt. Blend this with the rice flour and knead into a dough with greased hands. Warm a few banana leaves and lubricate with ghee. Alternatively, you can use baking paper too. Now, you have to take a ball-sized dough, flatten it on a leaf and take a tablespoon full of the jaggery mix to spread on it. Fold the banana leaf and seal from the sides. Make multiple wraps and steam in a steamer for 15 minutes. Voila! Your sweet treat is set.  </p>

                            Are you into Rajasthani food? Then you must go for this lamb masterpiece, created with red chillies and a variety of masalas. <br> <br>

Start by taking some water in a heavy-bottomed pan, add 10 Kashmiri red chillies soaked for at least 20 minutes, along with a teaspoon of cumin seeds, 2 black cardamoms, 3 green cardamoms, an inch of a cinnamon stick, 3 cloves, and a bay leaf. Then grind these roasted whole spices. Next, mix 500gm of mutton, half a cup of yogurt, 2tsp of cumin powder, 2tsp coriander powder, a tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and the spices you ground earlier, and leave the marinated meat in the fridge for an hour. Warm some ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan, to it add 3 finely chopped onions and sauté until light brown. Add another tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute. Now, add the refrigerated mutton mix and brown on high heat. Then cover and cook for about 20 minutes. If possible, light a piece of charcoal and place it in a small metal bowl in the middle of the pan for an authentic taste.
